My personal website. A simple static site deployed on Vercel.

## What's here

- `index.html` — the whole site (for now)

## To update

1. Edit `index.html`
2. Commit and push to `main`
3. Vercel auto-deploys

## Sections

- **Bio** — who I am, what I'm about
- **Writing** — links to my three Substacks
- **Now** — what I'm currently working on (update this whenever)
- **Elsewhere** — LinkedIn, GitHub

## Future

- Photography section
- Maybe individual pages if it outgrows one file

Built with plain HTML/CSS. No frameworks, no build step, no nonsense.
